3 ActiveMQ servers clustered together in a mesh foramt:


                      broker1
                    /         \
		   /           \
		  /             \
               broker2 ------ broker3


This configuration is redundant - a failure in any one
connection will result in the traffic being rerouted via
other links.

Pay attention to the names in the config file as well 
as the users.  This is identical to the simple single
broker example except with the aded amq user for the 
clustering and the connection setups in broker1

This configuration requires at least version 5.4.0 of 
ActiveMQ
