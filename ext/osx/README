This script will automatically build Mac packages based on your source
tarball.  The only argument is the path to the untarred source directory.

It automatically determines the MCollective version so it will only work
with 0.4.9 and forward.  It loads mcollective in ruby so it requires
that the stomp rubygem be installed.

I could just grep the mcollective.rb script but I wanted it to be future proof.
It also requires XCode be installed to have PackageMaker available.  It sets
the server.cfg file daemonize setting to 0 since my launchd plist will handle
that.  I also have launchd set to restart mcollectived if it stops running.

Let me know if you run in to trouble with it.
