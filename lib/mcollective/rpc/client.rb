            # text and codes as above you'll also need to handle the following exceptions:
            #
            # UnknownRPCAction - There is no matching action on the agent
            # MissingRPCData - You did not supply all the needed parameters for the action
            # InvalidRPCData - The data you did supply did not pass validation
            # UnknownRPCError - Some other error prevented the agent from running
            #

            # only get back the requestid, you have no indication about results.
            #
            # You can invoke this using:
